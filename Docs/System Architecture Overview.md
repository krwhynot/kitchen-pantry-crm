Architecture Pattern Overview
Hybrid Architecture Design
Kitchen Pantry CRM implements a three-tier hybrid architecture that combines the benefits of modern single-page applications with the reliability of traditional server-side processing. The architecture consists of:
Frontend Layer (Vue.js 3): Handles user interface rendering, client-side state management, and real-time data synchronization. The frontend communicates directly with Supabase for simple CRUD operations while routing complex business logic through the Node.js middleware layer.
Middleware Layer (Node.js/Express): Serves as an intelligent API gateway that processes business rules, validates requests, orchestrates complex database operations, and provides custom authentication flows beyond basic Supabase Auth capabilities.
Backend Services (Supabase): Provides PostgreSQL database with Row Level Security (RLS), real-time subscriptions, authentication services, and file storage capabilities. Supabase handles the infrastructure concerns while allowing custom business logic implementation.
Progressive Enhancement Strategy
The system architecture supports a phased migration approach from static HTML templates to a fully dynamic Vue.js application:
Phase 1 - Component Wrapping: Existing HTML templates are wrapped in Vue components while maintaining their original structure and styling. This approach allows immediate deployment with Vue Router navigation and basic reactivity.
Phase 2 - State Integration: Pinia stores are introduced for global state management, API calls are implemented through the Node.js middleware, and Supabase authentication is integrated for user session management.
Phase 3 - Full Reactivity: Static content is converted to dynamic data-driven components, real-time features are implemented through Supabase subscriptions, and Progressive Web App capabilities are added for offline functionality.

Data Architecture
Database Design Principles
The Kitchen Pantry CRM database follows normalized relational design principles optimized for food service industry workflows. The schema supports multi-tenant architecture through Row Level Security policies while maintaining query performance through strategic indexing.
Core Entity Relationships: Organizations serve as the primary entity, with Contacts belonging to Organizations, Interactions linking Contacts and Users, and Opportunities tracking sales pipeline progression. This relationship structure mirrors real-world food service business relationships.
Audit Trail Implementation: All critical entities include created_at, updated_at, and created_by fields for comprehensive audit trails. Database triggers automatically populate these fields, ensuring data integrity and compliance requirements.
Soft Delete Strategy: Important records use soft deletion through is_deleted boolean flags rather than physical deletion. This approach preserves data integrity for reporting and audit purposes while maintaining referential integrity.
Row Level Security (RLS) Implementation
Supabase's Row Level Security provides tenant isolation and access control at the database level. RLS policies ensure users can only access data within their organization while supporting role-based permissions for different user types.
Organization-based Isolation: Users can only access Organizations, Contacts, and related data where they have explicit permissions. This isolation is enforced at the database level, preventing data leakage even if application-level security is compromised.
Role-based Access Control: Different user roles (Admin, Manager, Sales Rep) have varying levels of data access defined through RLS policies. These policies are evaluated for every database query, ensuring consistent security enforcement.
Dynamic Policy Evaluation: RLS policies can evaluate user context, time-based restrictions, and data sensitivity levels to provide granular access control. This flexibility supports complex business rules while maintaining security.
API Architecture
RESTful API Design
The Node.js middleware layer exposes RESTful APIs that follow standard HTTP conventions while adding business logic validation and processing. The API design prioritizes consistency, discoverability, and ease of integration.
Resource-based Endpoints: API endpoints are organized around business resources (organizations, contacts, interactions, opportunities) with standard HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) for CRUD operations.
Consistent Response Format: All API responses follow a standardized format including status codes, data payload, error messages, and metadata. This consistency simplifies frontend integration and error handling.
Pagination and Filtering: List endpoints support pagination, sorting, and filtering parameters to handle large datasets efficiently. These features are essential for CRM systems managing thousands of contacts and interactions.
API Gateway Pattern
The Node.js layer implements an API Gateway pattern that provides a single entry point for frontend requests while orchestrating backend services. This pattern enables request transformation, response aggregation, and business rule enforcement.
Request Validation: All incoming requests are validated against defined schemas using libraries like Joi or Zod. Invalid requests are rejected with descriptive error messages before reaching the database layer.
Business Logic Orchestration: Complex operations requiring multiple database queries or external service calls are orchestrated through the API gateway. This approach keeps business logic centralized and maintainable.
Response Transformation: Database responses are transformed into frontend-friendly formats, including data aggregation, calculated fields, and relationship resolution. This processing reduces frontend complexity and improves performance.
Security Architecture
Authentication and Authorization
Kitchen Pantry CRM implements a multi-layered security approach combining Supabase Auth for user management with custom authorization logic in the Node.js middleware layer.
Supabase Authentication Integration: User registration, login, password reset, and session management are handled through Supabase Auth, which provides secure JWT token generation and validation. This integration eliminates the need for custom authentication implementation while ensuring security best practices.
JWT Token Validation: The Node.js middleware validates JWT tokens on every request, ensuring only authenticated users can access protected resources. Token validation includes signature verification, expiration checking, and user context extraction.
Role-based Authorization: User roles and permissions are stored in the database and evaluated during API requests. The authorization system supports hierarchical roles with inheritance, allowing flexible permission management.
