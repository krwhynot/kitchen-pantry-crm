# Quality Assurance Processes

## Overview

Quality assurance processes ensure **consistent code quality**, **comprehensive testing coverage**, and **continuous improvement** throughout the Kitchen Pantry CRM development lifecycle. This includes **automated quality gates**, **manual testing procedures**, and **continuous monitoring**.

## Code Quality Standards

### Linting and Formatting

The Kitchen Pantry CRM implements **comprehensive code quality standards** with automated enforcement and continuous monitoring to ensure maintainable, reliable code.

#### ESLint Configuration

```json
// .eslintrc.json
{
  "extends": [
    "@vue/typescript/recommended",
    "@vue/prettier",
    "plugin:vue/vue3-recommended",
    "plugin:@typescript-eslint/recommended",
    "plugin:jsx-a11y/recommended"
  ],
  "rules": {
    "vue/component-name-in-template-casing": ["error", "PascalCase"],
    "vue/require-default-prop": "error",
    "vue/require-prop-types": "error",
    "@typescript-eslint/no-unused-vars": "error",
    "@typescript-eslint/explicit-function-return-type": "warn",
    "jsx-a11y/click-events-have-key-events": "error",
    "jsx-a11y/no-static-element-interactions": "error"
  ],
  "overrides": [
    {
      "files": ["**/*.test.ts", "**/*.spec.ts"],
      "rules": {
        "@typescript-eslint/no-explicit-any": "off"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

#### Prettier Configuration

- **Data validation**: 90% minimum coverage
- **Security functions**: 95% minimum coverage

#### Jest Coverage Configuration

```javascript
// jest.config.js
module.exports = {
  collectCoverageFrom: [
    'src/**/*.{ts,vue}',
    '!src/**/*.d.ts',
    '!src/**/*.test.ts',
    '!src/**/*.spec.ts',
    '!src/main.ts',

npm run type-check || {
  echo "❌ Type checking failed. Please fix the issues before committing."
  exit 1
}

# Run unit tests

  exit 1
}

# Check formatting
npm run format:check || {
  echo "❌ Code formatting issues found. Run 'npm run format' to fix."
  exit 1
}

```

#### Pre-push Hooks

```bash
# .husky/pre-push
#!/usr/bin/env sh

## Manual Testing Procedures

### Usability Testing

Manual testing procedures complement automated testing with **human validation** of user experience, accessibility, and edge cases that cannot be effectively automated.

#### Usability Testing Sessions

**Duration**: 60-90 minutes per session
**Participants**: 5-8 users representing different roles (sales reps, managers, administrators)

**Test Scenarios:**
1. **First-time user onboarding**: Complete registration and initial setup
2. **Daily workflow tasks**: Log interactions, manage contacts, update opportunities
3. **Data entry and validation**: Create organizations, contacts, and interactions
4. **Search and filtering**: Find specific information quickly
5. **Mobile/tablet usage**: Complete tasks on iPad and mobile devices

**Metrics Tracked:**
- Task completion rate
- Time to complete tasks
- Error rate and recovery
- User satisfaction scores
- Feature adoption rates

    this.metrics.get(name)!.push({
      value,
      timestamp: new Date()
