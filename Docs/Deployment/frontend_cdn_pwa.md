title: Frontend CDN and PWA Deployment

This section details the frontend deployment architecture, focusing on static site generation, global CDN distribution, and comprehensive Progressive Web App (PWA) capabilities for optimal performance and offline functionality.

## Frontend Deployment Architecture

### Static Site Generation and CDN Deployment

The Vue.js frontend is built as a static site with dynamic capabilities through API integration and client-side routing. Static site generation provides optimal performance, security, and scalability while supporting Progressive Web App features.

**Build Process:** Vite build system generates optimized static assets including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and media files. The build process includes code splitting, tree shaking, and asset optimization for minimal bundle sizes and fast loading times.

**CDN Distribution:** Static assets are deployed to global CDN networks with automatic cache invalidation and version management. CDN deployment includes custom domain configuration, SSL certificate management, and performance optimization.

**Cache Strategy:** Aggressive caching for static assets with intelligent cache invalidation for dynamic content. Cache strategy includes browser caching, CDN caching, and service worker caching for optimal performance and offline capabilities.

Progressive Web App Deployment
The frontend includes comprehensive PWA capabilities with service worker deployment, manifest configuration, and offline functionality.

Service Worker Deployment: Service worker registration with automatic updates and cache management. Service worker deployment includes background sync, push notifications, and offline capabilities.

App Manifest Configuration: Web app manifest with icon sets, theme colors, and installation prompts. Manifest configuration supports native-like installation on mobile devices and desktop platforms.

Offline Capabilities: Comprehensive offline functionality with local data storage and sync capabilities. Offline features include cached data access, offline form submission, and automatic synchronization when connectivity is restored.
