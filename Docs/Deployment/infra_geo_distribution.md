This section describes how the Kitchen Pantry CRM infrastructure is globally distributed to ensure optimal performance for users across different regions and time zones.

### Geographic Distribution

The infrastructure implements global distribution to provide optimal performance for food service professionals operating across different regions and time zones.

**Multi-Region CDN:** Frontend assets are distributed across global CDN networks with edge locations in major metropolitan areas. CDN distribution ensures fast loading times regardless of user location while providing redundancy and failover capabilities.

**Database Replication:** Supabase provides read replicas in multiple regions for improved query performance and disaster recovery. Database replication includes automatic failover and data consistency guarantees essential for CRM operations.

**Edge Computing:** Static site generation and edge functions provide server-side rendering and API processing at edge locations. Edge computing reduces latency for dynamic content while maintaining global scalability.
