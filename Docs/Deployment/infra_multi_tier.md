This section describes the three-tier architecture model employed by the Kitchen Pantry CRM, separating presentation, application logic, and data storage for independent scaling and enhanced security.

## Infrastructure Architecture Overview

### Multi-Tier Deployment Model

The Kitchen Pantry CRM infrastructure follows a three-tier architecture pattern that separates presentation, application logic, and data storage concerns. This separation enables independent scaling, maintenance, and optimization of each tier while providing clear security boundaries and deployment flexibility.

**Presentation Tier (Frontend):** Vue.js application deployed to global CDN networks through Vercel or Netlify, providing optimal performance for users worldwide. The presentation tier includes static assets, Progressive Web App (PWA) capabilities, and client-side routing with automatic cache invalidation and deployment previews.

**Application Tier (Backend):** Node.js/Express API services managed through Supabase MCP tools and deployed to platforms like Railway or Render, providing scalable compute resources with automatic scaling based on demand. The application tier includes business logic processing, authentication middleware, and external service integration with health monitoring and load balancing.

**Data Tier (Database):** Supabase managed PostgreSQL with automatic scaling, backup management, and real-time capabilities. The data tier includes primary database storage, file storage services, and authentication services with built-in security, monitoring, and compliance features.
