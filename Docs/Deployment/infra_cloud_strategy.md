This section details the multi-cloud approach adopted for the Kitchen Pantry CRM infrastructure, aiming to optimize cost, performance, and reliability while minimizing vendor lock-in.

### Cloud Provider Strategy

The infrastructure utilizes a multi-cloud approach to optimize cost, performance, and reliability while avoiding vendor lock-in. The strategy emphasizes managed services to reduce operational overhead and accelerate development velocity.

**Primary Cloud Services:** Supabase provides the core data platform including PostgreSQL database, authentication services, real-time subscriptions, and file storage. Supabase's managed approach eliminates database administration overhead while providing enterprise-grade features and automatic scaling.

**CDN and Edge Computing:** Vercel or Netlify provides global content delivery with edge computing capabilities for optimal frontend performance. CDN services include automatic SSL certificates, custom domains, and deployment automation with preview environments for development workflows.

**Backend Hosting:** Railway or Render provides hosting for Node.js backend services managed through Supabase MCP tools, with automatic scaling, health monitoring, and deployment automation. These platforms offer simplified deployment workflows while maintaining flexibility for custom configurations through MCP integration.
