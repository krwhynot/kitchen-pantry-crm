## Quick Start Guide

### 1. Configure Business Rules
Start by defining your business rules in the rule engine:
```typescript
// Example: Lead scoring rule
const leadScoringRule = {
  name: "Enterprise Company Scoring",
  conditions: [
    { field: "company.size", operator: "equals", value: "enterprise" }
  ],
  actions: [
    { type: "set_field", parameters: { field: "score", value: 25 } }
  ]
}
```

### 2. Design Workflows
Create automated workflows for your key processes:
```typescript
// Example: Lead nurturing workflow
const nurtureWorkflow = {
  name: "Enterprise Lead Nurturing",
  trigger: { type: "event", event: "lead_qualified" },
  steps: [
    { type: "delay", duration: 86400 }, // 24 hours
    { type: "action", action: "send_email", template: "welcome_enterprise" },
    { type: "human_task", assignee: "sales_manager", title: "Follow up with lead" }
  ]
}
```

### 3. Monitor and Optimize
